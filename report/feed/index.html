<p>Editor: This is an in-depth review of <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-academic-writing-made-easy-13157">Academic Writing Made Easy</a> by <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/university/tum">TUM (Technical University of Munich)</a>. Although this course is in Class Central&#8217;s list of <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/collection/top-free-online-courses">Best Free Online Courses of All Time</a>, it is currently unavailable for enrollments. Meanwhile, check out <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/writing-free-online-courses/">170 Free Online Writing Courses to Improve Your Skills</a>.</p>
<h2>Why did I take this course?</h2>
<p>My writing skills were nowhere near perfect, the additional lack of confidence in myself made it worse. I could not get anything written down without giving up. I could not understand how some people came up with amazing texts, expressing themselves wonderfully, using colossal words, and correct grammar. I did not know how to express myself in words. Though the thought was clear, writing it down was the hard part. Moving into college with that same mindset and needing proper guidance on the subject, I searched for a few writing courses with the help of Class Central and I found <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-academic-writing-made-easy-13157">Academic writing made easy</a> by the <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/university/tum">Technical University of Munich</a>. After taking this course, I now believe that writing is not some magical gift only intelligent people can wield, it is a skill anyone can be good at if one is taught properly and that is exactly what this course will do. It teaches you the step-by-step basics of writing, explains the science behind good writing, and helps you build more confidence.</p>
<h2>What is required to take this course?</h2>
<p>There are only a few requirements to take this course. As an English course, it requires an upper-intermediate (B2) to advanced (C1) level in the English Language. A laptop may also be required because some of the exercises are not compatible with a mobile device. The course is very easy to take without having any of these challenges.</p>
<h2>Should you upgrade to get a certificate?</h2>
<p>The course has both a free version and an upgraded version. The free version gives you access to all the video lessons, graded exercises, forums, and Q&amp;A sections. While the upgraded version provides unlimited access to the contents and videos in addition to two tests; a mid-term and a final test, then a verified certificate, which looks good on your resume. By upgrading to the verified version, you would also be supporting the producers of the course.</p>
<h2>About the course</h2>
<p>This 6 weeks course is taught by a few lecturers namely: Dr. Heidi Minning, Jeremiah Hendren, Dr. Stephen Starck, Dr. Aparna Bhar, Susan O’Byrne, Rose Jacobs, and Ruth Shannon. They are a team of exceptional lecturers, who individually are experienced in the arts of writing. The course has been tailored for every level: a beginner, trying to build a strong foundation; an intermediate, and an advanced writer, who wants to sharpen their skill. It covers the step-by-step basics of writing and organizing your text. Each week contains video lessons and graded exercises that explain how your writing is to appeal to your audience, understanding the genre and tone of each type of text. It also teaches cohesion: how to make your ideas flow logically. I appreciated how it explained how to write a reader-friendly sentence, how to be credible, make your reader understand and believe your text, and an in-depth explanation of punctuation. My favorite was when Jeremiah Hendren gave a lecture on overcoming writer&#8217;s block, which helped me build more confidence in writing. It is not a time-consuming course as it is self-paced, where you can set goals of 2-3 hours per week. It also provides a forum, where you can associate with your peers and a Q&amp;A, with instant replies.</p>
<h2>Why do I feel you will enjoy the course?</h2>
<p>For the time I spent taking the course, I was very satisfied. Each time I finished a unit of the course, I was excited about the progress I was making and how much knowledge I was uncovering. I genuinely recommend this course to anyone struggling to write academically. It is easy, professional yet fun, and consumes less time. I hope your experience is as splendid as mine was.</p>

<p>This is an in-depth review of the free-to-audit course <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/econtransform1-8348">China’s Economic Transformation Part 1: Economic Reform and Growth in China</a> by <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/university/hkust">The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a> via Coursera.</p>
<h2>China economic transformation history</h2>
<p>In 1978, after nearly 30 years of socialist planning under Mao Zedong, China was one of the poorest countries in the World, with a highly inefficient and inward-looking economy.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85479" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-content.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-content.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-content-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-content-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>From 1978 through 2015, China grew at an average annual growth rate of 10% per year. Today, China has the largest GDP (Gross domestic product) of any country in the world and is the world&#8217;s largest trading nation. Deng Xiaoping undertook fundamental economic reforms that unleashed market forces, opened the country to the outside world, and lifted millions of Chinese out of poverty</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85480" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-instructor.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-instructor.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-instructor-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-instructor-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>All economists around the World try hard to think about what to do to bring economic success to emergent countries and are curious about how China could be the unique emergent country that indeed made it and became a thriving economy. China promises to wipe all the poverty, hunger, and underdevelopment out. How do they do it?</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85481" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-GDP.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-GDP.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-GDP-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-GDP-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>More than that, how can we grasp this knowledge without falling in the trap of political bias and preconception, with no cold war propaganda, analyzing objectively the most important aspects of the Chinese economy?</p>
<h2>The Instructor</h2>
<figure id="attachment_85482" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-85482" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-85482" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-presentation.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-presentation.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-presentation-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Chinas-Economic-Transformation-Part-1_-Economic-Reform-and-Growth-presentation-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-85482" class="wp-caption-text">Professor Albert Francis Park, course instructor.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The man for this job is Professor Albert Francis Park who teaches the Coursera MOOC <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/econtransform1-8348">China’s Economic Transformation</a>. You will learn the Deng Xiaoping principle of gradual reform, “crossing the river by feeling the stones”, allying millennial Taoist knowledge to modern economic technology.</p>
<p>Albert Francis Park came from Korea Development Institute, where he was a Research Assistant in 1988. After that, he passed a hard proficiency training in Chinese (1992) that enabled him to deeply study the Chinese reforms. Fluent in Chinese and English, Albert Francis Park Undergraduate as Bachelor of Arts at Oxford and got his PhD at Stanford in 1996. With academic positions at the University of Michigan, Oxford and Stanford, he is now an outstanding teaching professor at Hong Kong University and active in many institutes of emergent development and on the editorial board of the main journals of comparative economics and emergent development. He is the director of the Institute for Emerging Market Studies.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and what’s next</h2>
<p>Chinese tradition involves hard work and this course is no different. There’s lots of information, reading, and material to study, so learn carefully, take notes, and study, because the tests are carefully made to check the assimilation of the didactic material.</p>
<p>After completing this course, as part 2 is still not available, I recommend the following courses: <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/chinesepolitics1-3790">Chinese Politics Part 1 – China and Political Science</a> and <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/chinesepolitics2-3791">Chinese Politics Part 2 – China and the World</a>.</p>

<p>The research on <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/help/moocs">Massive Open Online Courses</a> (MOOCs) is at least as old as the introduction of the first MOOC. MOOCs and learning analytics gave researchers a unique opportunity to follow students closely on their learning path. This generated new findings on the learning habits of students, developed the knowledge on learning technology further and derived evidence-based recommendations for instructional designers. To get an overview of the topics and trends in the research on MOOCs we have created a list of the most cited research papers on MOOCs.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>In an attempt to have an overview of the most cited research papers in the field of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on Google Scholar, we combined the search results of relevant search terms (and their plurals) “MOOC” (about 61K results), “Massive Open Online Course” (about 35K), and “e-learning” (about 630K) in the following list. We have only included articles published since 2008. The short description under the title is extracted from the abstracts of the articles.</p>
<h2>Twenty Most Cited MOOC Research Papers</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556325.2566239">How video production affects student engagement: An empirical study of MOOC videos</a></strong> (2014) by PJ Guo, J Kim, R Rubin<br />
The study analyzes 6.9 million video watching sessions across four courses on edX to measure student engagement with online educational videos. The findings suggest that shorter videos, informal talking-head videos, and Khan-style tablet drawings are more engaging. The study also highlights the importance of understanding how students engage with different types of videos and recommends that instructors and video producers leverage the online video format accordingly. The anonymized data set and analysis scripts are publicly available.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://jime.open.ac.uk/articles/10.5334/2012-18">Making sense of MOOCs: Musings in a maze of myth, paradox and possibility</a></strong> (2012) by J Daniel<br />
This paper provides a history of MOOCs and contextualizes them within the evolution of educational technology and open/distance learning. While the hype around MOOCs focuses on their scale, the real revolution is that universities with scarcity at the heart of their business models are embracing openness. The paper explores paradoxes and debunks myths associated with the MOOC movement, highlighting the potential for competition among participating institutions to improve teaching quality and reduce costs of higher education.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/irrodl/1900-v1-n1-irrodl05095/1066922ar/abstract/"><strong>MOOCs: A systematic study of the published literature 2008-2012</strong></a> (2013) Tharindu Rekha Liyanagunawardena, Andrew Alexandar Adams, and Shirley Ann Williams<br />
This paper presents a systematic review of published MOOC literature from 2008-2012, identifying 45 peer-reviewed papers across eight areas of interest. MOOCs are recognised as having the potential to deliver education globally, and this review provides a quantitative analysis of publications according to publication type, year of publication, and contributors. The authors explore future research directions guided by gaps in the literature.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ej1062850">Studying learning in the worldwide classroom research into edX&#8217;s first MOOC.</a> </strong>(2013) by Lori Breslow, David E. Pritchard, Jennifer DeBoer, Glenda S. Stump, Andrew D. Ho, Daniel T. Seaton<br />
&#8220;Circuits and Electronics&#8221; was the first MOOC developed by edX, attracting over 155,000 students in 2012. Researchers analyzed the data generated by the course and found insights about students&#8217; resource use and achievement. A second stage of research is underway to examine the background and capabilities of the students and their interactions with the course&#8217;s components to understand their level of success.</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2460296.2460330"><strong>Deconstructing disengagement: analyzing learner subpopulations in massive open online courses</strong></a> (2013) by René F. Kizilcec, Chris Piech, Emily Schneider<br />
A classification method has been developed to identify longitudinal engagement trajectories in three computer science MOOCs. This method identifies four prototypical trajectories of engagement, including learners who stay engaged without taking assessments. The trajectories can be used to compare learner engagement across different courses and demographics, informing future interventions, research, and design directions for MOOCs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/irrodl/1900-v1-n1-irrodl04927/1065273ar/abstract/"><strong>Initial Trends in Enrolment and Completion of Massive Open Online Courses</strong></a> (2014) by K Jordan<br />
This paper examines the public data available on enrolment and completion rates in MOOCs. The average course enrolls 43,000 students, with a completion rate of 6.5%, and enrolment numbers are decreasing over time. Completion rates are consistent across time, university rank, and total enrolment, but negatively correlated with course length. The study provides a more accurate view of how the MOOC field is developing.</p>

Self-directed learning on open online networks is now a possibility as communication and resources can be combined to create learning environments. But is it really? There are some challenges that might prevent learners from having a quality learning experience. This paper raises questions on levels of learner autonomy, presence, and critical literacies required in active connectivist learning.</p>

Summary of summary: The paper reviews published literature on MOOCs, identifying reasons for student enrollment as learning, curiosity, challenge, and certification, while high dropout rates result from insufficient incentives, poor comprehension, and other priorities. Instructors&#8217; motivations are intrigue, personal rewards, and altruism, but they face difficulties in evaluating student work, feedback, and low participation. MOOC education quality and assessment are unresolved issues.</p>

This report provides decision makers in higher education institutions with an understanding of MOOCs and trends towards greater openness in higher education, including the changes currently taking place in higher education due to globalization and constrained budgets. The report, written from a UK perspective, uses a literature review to identify current debates about new course provision, funding changes, and implications for greater openness in higher education. The theory of disruptive innovation is used to help institutions address policy and strategy questions.</p>

In this study, the instructional design quality of 76 randomly selected Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) was analyzed using a course survey instrument. Two types of MOOCs were analyzed and their instructional design quality was assessed and compared. The majority of MOOCs scored poorly on most instructional design principles, indicating that although most MOOCs are well-packaged, their instructional design quality is low. Implications for practice and ideas for future research are outlined.</p>

This article discusses the rise of open online courses (OOCs) with a massive number of students, such as the artificial intelligence course CS221 offered by Stanford in 2011 which attracted 160,000 registered students. While both AI and connectivist MOOCs (c MOOCs) have been identified as equivalent in many instances, the article argues that the format associated with c-MOOCs is unique and different from AI due to its participative pedagogical model, which aligns with connectivist pedagogy. The article also discusses the evolution of distance education pedagogy, which has progressed from cognitive-behaviorist to social constructivist to connectivist models. The article includes tables and figures for further detail.</p>

This article discusses how Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) present challenges for mainstream learning analytics practices, and highlights the high dropout rates in MOOCs compared to traditional education. The article introduces the metaphor of a &#8216;funnel of participation&#8217; to describe the pattern of steep drop-offs and unequal participation in MOOCs and similar learning environments. Empirical data from three online learning sites are presented to support the funnel of participation concept. The article concludes with a discussion on the implications of the funnel for MOOCs, formal education, and learning analytics practice.</p>
<p><a href="https://pure.port.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/108952/The_Ideals_and_Realilty_of_Participating_in_a_MOOC.pdf"><strong>The ideals and reality of participating in a MOOC</strong></a> (2010) by J Mackness, S Mak, R Williams<br />
The paper discusses a MOOC called ‘CCK08’ which focused on the emergent practices and theory of Connectivism. Over 2000 participants from around the world registered for the course, with some enrolled for credit. The paper explores the perspectives of participants on their learning experiences in the course in relation to the characteristics of connectivism outlined by Stephen Downes. The research found that the more autonomous, diverse and open the course, and the more connected the learners, the more potential for learning to be limited by the lack of structure, support, and moderation normally associated with an online course. The research suggests that further studies are needed to investigate whether a large open online network can be fused with a course.</p>

This paper discusses the importance of self-regulated learning (SRL) skills in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and how effective implementation of learner support systems requires an understanding of which SRL strategies are most effective and how these strategies manifest in online behavior. The authors investigated SRL in a sample of 4,831 learners across six MOOCs and found that goal setting and strategic planning predicted attainment of personal course goals, while help seeking was associated with lower goal attainment. Learners with stronger SRL skills were more likely to revisit previously studied course materials, especially course assessments. The paper concludes by discussing implications for theory and the development of learning environments that provide adaptive support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/irrodl/1900-v1-n1-irrodl05118/1067320ar/abstract/"><strong>A Pedagogy of Abundance or a Pedagogy to Support Human Beings? Participant Support on Massive Open Online Courses</strong></a> (2011) by Rita Kop, Hélène Fournier and John Sui Fai Mak<br />
This paper explores how new technologies could impact the design of learning environments, with a focus on the roles of educators and learners in creating networked learning experiences on MOOCs. The paper proposes a pedagogy that supports learners and course facilitators in creating resources and learning places through collaboration, building a community of learners, and utilizing information flows on networks. This aligns with the idea of emergent learning, where actors and systems co-evolve in a MOOC, and the level of presence of actors on the MOOC influences learning outcomes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/643"><strong>The technological dimension of a massive open online course: The case of the CCK08 course tools</strong></a> (2009) A Fini<br />
This paper focuses on technological aspects of the Connectivism and Connective Knowledge (CCK08) MOOC and investigates attitudes of lifelong learners towards learning network technologies. Findings show that time constraints, language barriers, and ICT skills affected participants’ choice of tools, and learners preferred passive mailing lists over interactive discussion forums and blogs. The paper recommends highlighting the pedagogical purpose of tools offered, giving learners the freedom to choose which tools to use, and conducting further research on sustainability and instructor workload issues in MOOCs. Investigation is also necessary to determine if terms such as course, drop-out, and attrition are appropriate in relation to MOOCs.</p>

Summary: MOOCs have gained public attention for their potential, but there are no robust, published data that describe who is taking these courses and why. An online survey of students enrolled in at least one of the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s 32 MOOCs shows that the student population tends to be young, well-educated, and employed, with a majority from developed countries. The main reasons for taking MOOCs are advancing in their current job and satisfying curiosity. Those without access to higher education in developing countries are underrepresented among early adopters.</p>

This study examined MOOC retention and completion rates of 379 students at a university in Cairo who were encouraged to take a MOOC of their own choice. Only 32.2% completed an entire course, with no significant differences based on gender, level of study, or MOOC platform. The study found that MOOC Course Content and interaction with the instructor were significant predictors of retention, explaining 79% of the variance.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Digital Art?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/creativecloud/illustration/discover/digital-art.html#:~:text=Digital%20art%20is%20any%20artwork%20that%20draws%20upon,long%20as%20they%E2%80%99re%20created%2C%20enhanced%20or%20exhibited%20digitally." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital art is any artwork that draws upon digital technology as an essential part of its creative process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It encompasses a wide range of techniques, from digital drawings, paintings and illustration, to photos, videos and even sculpture. All can be classed as digital art, so long as they’re created, enhanced or exhibited digitally.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the different forms of digital art include digital drawing, digital painting, digital sculpting, animation, pixel art, photography, and video. So you can understand that the spectrum of digital art is vast and enables you to explore and choose what you want to work on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the most popular digital art software include </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/best-adobe-illustrator-courses-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe Illustrator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/best-adobe-photoshop-courses-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adobe Photoshop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/best-procreate-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Procreate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You’ll get the opportunity to learn more about these applications and how to use them for your digital art in the courses in this guide.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are Digital Art Skills Important?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital art is also backed up by a ton of media outlets for artists on the web, from opportunities to develop content for social media and digital marketing, to animation and game development. This is certainly the perfect moment to start learning and improve your skills, even more considering the global art market was valued at 65.1 billion dollars in 2021, rapidly recovering to pre-pandemic levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are over 5,000 jobs available for digital artists on </span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/digital-artist-jobs-SRCH_KO0,14.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glassdoor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, nearly 400 jobs on LinkedIn, and nearly a hundred freelance jobs on </span><a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelance-jobs/digital-art/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upwork</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, the </span><a href="https://www.salary.com/research/salary/posting/digital-artist-salary" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">average salary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a digital artist is $67,020 a year in the United States (as of November 2022).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is My Experience with Digital Art?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as drawing on iPad is concerned, I’ve used apps such as Autodesk Sketchbook and Tayasui Sketches. And on my desktop, I’ve drawn in Photoshop using graphic tablets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides that, I am a </span><a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/archisha-bhar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guided Project Instructor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a Beta Tester at Coursera, having tested many courses before they’re officially launched. I have taken </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/@archisha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 50 online courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in various subjects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My experience as an online learner and teacher has given me some perspective on what to look for in an online course. I used my experience to evaluate each course in this list.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-79247 size-full" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-1.png" alt="Find your next course." width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-1.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-1-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-1-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Course Ranking Methodology</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology I used in previous rankings (</span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/category/best-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can find them all here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). It involves a three-step process:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Research:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I started by leveraging Class Central’s database with </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/subjects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100K online courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and 200K+ reviews. Then, I made a preliminary selection of </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/subject/digital-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.5K+ digital art courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by rating, reviews, and bookmarks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Evaluate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I read through reviews on Class Central, Reddit, and course providers to understand what other learners thought about each course and combined it with my own experience as a </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/@archisha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Select:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well-made courses were picked if they presented valuable and engaging content and they have to fit in a set of criteria and be ranked accordingly: comprehensive curriculum, release date, affordability, ratings and enrollments.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result is a unique selection of courses that combines a decade of Class Central data and my own experience as an online learner to try to get the best of both worlds. So far, I’ve spent more than 10 hours building this list, and I’ll continue to update it.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Course Ranking Statistics</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some statistics regarding this course ranking:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined, these courses have accrued over </span><b>120.4K</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enrollments.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The eighth edition of </span><a href="https://emoocs.hpi.de/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EMOOCs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the European MOOCs stakeholder summer, will take place at the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), in </span><a href="https://emoocs.hpi.de/index.php/location/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potsdam, Germany</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on June 14–16, 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference is dedicated to massive open online courses, from ideation to delivery to evaluation. This edition takes a particular interest in the pandemic’s long-lasting impact on MOOCs — most notably, regarding the role moving forward of online education within traditional education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the event was already set to take place at HPI but had to be moved online due to the pandemic. 2023 will mark the return to an in-person conference, though limited online participation will also be possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://emoocs.hpi.de/index.php/call-for-papers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call for papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been published. Submissions close on <strong>March 15, 2023</strong>.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Program</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the detailed agenda has yet to be determined, the conference will include keynotes, lightning talks, panel discussions, and interactive workshops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, the conference sessions will be broken down into five tracks:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://emoocs.hpi.de/index.php/business/"><b>Business</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focusing on MOOCs’ place in the enterprise world — most notably, how they may support workforce training and reskilling, and long-term business sustainability.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://emoocs.hpi.de/index.php/international/"><b>International</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focusing on MOOCs on the global stage, with a particular interest for MOOC projects and initiatives rooted in Latin America, Australia, Africa, and Asia.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://emoocs.hpi.de/index.php/policy/"><b>Policy</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focusing on the political and societal issues surrounding MOOCs, such as how policy design may support MOOC development with a view to benefiting the greater number.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://emoocs.hpi.de/index.php/research-and-experience/"><b>Research &amp; Experience</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focusing on the academic and practitioner perspective on MOOCs regarding topics such as instructional design, best use of technology, and outcome analysis.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://emoocs.hpi.de/index.php/workshops/"><b>Workshops</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, focusing on MOOC processes, operations, and know-how, through an interactive, participatory approach.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference will also be an opportunity to network. A poster session and social activities will facilitate discussion between participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once released, you’ll be able to find the </span><a href="https://emoocs.hpi.de/index.php/program/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full conference program here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call for Papers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference welcomes submissions on a wide variety of MOOC-related topics. This edition has three focal points:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The long-lasting impact of the pandemic on online education</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. COVID prompted a global move to online education. As a result, many people who’d never tried online learning before are now familiar with it. So now seems like a good time for a debrief. What was the impact of the pandemic on MOOCs and vice versa, and now that the pandemic impetus on online education has abated, what should be the role of MOOCs moving forward?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The normalization of online education as part of regular education</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Be it through the popularization of blended learning or the multiplication of MOOC-based online degrees over the last decade, the line between traditional education and online education has been getting blurrier. What should we expect next in this progression, and how do we get there?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>The global cooperation around MOOCs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. MOOCs are inherently a global phenomenon that calls for international cooperation. What are some of the promising MOOC projects underway, and how can their development be facilitated through cooperation?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Papers should be submitted in one of the five tracks, and they may take the form of lightweight proposals, short papers, full research papers, or workshop proposals. The conference welcomes the perspectives of many stakeholders, including educators, researchers, technologists, and decision-makers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline for submitting a paper is <strong>March 15, 2023</strong>. You can find the </span><a href="https://emoocs.hpi.de/index.php/call-for-papers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full call for papers here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p>Are you fed up with silly problems such as trying to center an image in a box or reuse visual elements on multiple web pages?</p>
<p>Does your code worry you even when it has been ‘completed’ and pushed to production?</p>
<p>Do you get tired of dealing with the complexity of other web development languages and frameworks?</p>
<p>Then you need to check out Elm.</p>
<p>Elm is a functional programming language for building front-end web applications. It&#8217;s highly expressive and easy to read, and it also has a strong focus on user-interface development, which makes it well-suited for building interactive web applications. Many of the latest functional features such as immutability, stateless functions, anonymous functions, and pattern matching are incorporated into the language. But the best part is Elm’s very own architecture which makes managing data flow between various components a breeze.</p>
<p>Elm is a perfect choice for developers who want to build high-quality, interactive web applications with ease and efficiency, which is why companies such as Microsoft, IBM,  NoRedInk, and Prezi use Elm for their front-end applications.</p>

<h2>What is Elm?</h2>
<p>Elm is a functional programming language for building front-end web applications, initially designed by Evan Czaplicki in 2012. He found that <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2015/10/alumni-profile-evan-czaplicki-ab-12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web development was often difficult, error-prone, and frustrating</a>, and he wanted to create a language that would make it easier to build high-quality, interactive web applications. And thus, Elm was born.</p>
<p>Elm is robust. It’s almost impossible to have runtime errors in Elm thanks to its robust static type system, which ensures that the type of variables must be specified before it can be used (either manually or inferred). Hence, a lot of time and effort is saved when it comes to debugging and testing.</p>
<p>Elm also provides a standardized, novel architecture (Model-View-Update) for organizing code, making data flow management between components easy and eliminating the need to compare and contrast multiple frameworks, allowing developers to focus on the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Elm is lightweight and performant. Elm compiles to a small JavaScript file size, making it ideal for web development, especially for applications with limited resources or slow internet connections. Yet, it is even faster than most popular JavaScript frameworks — even without optimizations. Just look at the following graphs!</p>
<figure id="attachment_85505" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-85505" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-85505" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/asset-sizes.png" alt="" width="740" height="500" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/asset-sizes.png 740w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/asset-sizes-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-85505" class="wp-caption-text">from <a href="https://elm-lang.org/news/small-assets-without-the-headache" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Small Assets without the Headache</a></figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_85506" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-85506" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-85506" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/everyone.png" alt="" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/everyone.png 800w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/everyone-300x188.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/everyone-768x480.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-85506" class="wp-caption-text">from <a href="https://elm-lang.org/news/blazing-fast-html-round-two" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blazing Fast HTML</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Elm is maintainable. Elm, as a functional language, comes with features you’d expect such as immutability, stateless functions, anonymous functions, and pattern matching, that reduces the complexity of code (such as states). Elm can also easily interoperate with existing JavaScript code, so you don’t have to rewrite everything in Elm (yet).</p>
<p>Elm is simple. Although its syntax is inspired by the Meta Language family of languages (like <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/best-free-haskell-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haskell</a> and <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/best-ocaml-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OCaml</a>), which are known for their steep learning curve, Elm instead opts for a simpler yet expressive syntax. Hence, Elm is not only easy-to-learn, but it is also easy-to-reason.</p>
<p>If Elm is so great, <a href="https://github.com/jah2488/elm-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who is using it</a>? Some of the biggest examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.noredink.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NoRedInk</a>: A popular online marketplace website for language learning, which was one of the first large-scale Elm applications (Evan Czaplicki currently works here).</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://prezi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prezi</a>: A cloud-based presentation software and storytelling tool that uses Elm for the development of their web-based editor (Evan Czaplicki started on Elm here).</li>
<li aria-level="1"><a href="http://brilliant.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brilliant</a>: An educational website that offers interactive math and science courses for students and professionals. Most of Brilliant’s interactives as well as the <a href="https://youtu.be/gT9Xu-ctNqI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diagrammar</a> tool is built in Elm.</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-79248 size-full" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-2.png" alt="Find your next course." width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-2.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-2-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-2-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology</h2>
<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/category/best-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can find them all here</a>). It involves a three-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Research:</b> I started by leveraging Class Central’s database with <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/subjects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100K online courses</a> and 200K+ reviews. Then, I made a preliminary selection of <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/subject/elm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elm courses</a> by rating, reviews, and bookmarks.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Evaluate:</b> I read through reviews on Class Central, Reddit, and course providers to understand what other learners thought about each course and combined it with my own experience as a <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/@Elham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learner</a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Select:</b> Well-made courses were picked if they presented valuable and engaging content and they have to fit in a set of criteria and be ranked accordingly: comprehensive curriculum, affordability, release date, ratings and enrollments.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Course Ranking Statistics</h2>
<p>Here are some aggregate stats about the ranking:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">All of the courses in this ranking use the latest major version of Elm, 0.19.</li>
<li aria-level="1">All of the courses except for one are <b>free</b> or provide a <b>free trial</b>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">All of the courses are suitable for beginners to Elm programming. Unfortunately, none are geared towards complete beginners to programming.</li>
<li aria-level="1">One of the courses is for advanced Elm programmers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without further ado, let’s go through the top picks.</p>
<h2 id="anchor-1">1. <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/independent-a-gentle-introduction-to-elm-programming-language-122049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beginning Elm: a gentle introduction to Elm programming language (Pawan Poudel)</a></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85498" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1.-Beginning-Elm_-a-gentle-introduction-to-Elm-programming-language-Pawan-Poudel.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1.-Beginning-Elm_-a-gentle-introduction-to-Elm-programming-language-Pawan-Poudel.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1.-Beginning-Elm_-a-gentle-introduction-to-Elm-programming-language-Pawan-Poudel-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1.-Beginning-Elm_-a-gentle-introduction-to-Elm-programming-language-Pawan-Poudel-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>My #1 pick for the best Elm course is <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/independent-a-gentle-introduction-to-elm-programming-language-122049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beginning Elm</a> authored by Pawan Poudel.</p>
<p>This <b>free</b> online book is a gentle introduction to the Elm programming language. I chose this as my top pick as it is full of bite-sized nuggets of information. You’ll learn the basic syntax and semantics of Elm and gradually shift towards building interactive modern web applications, picking up the best design principles and patterns that can be applied to every programming language out there.</p>
<p>You should have a basic understanding of programming to take this course, as well as a solid foundation in HTML/CSS.</p>
<h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>The course begins with a brief introduction to Elm programming where you’ll install the Elm Platform and explore the various high-level tools and concepts needed to build a simple web-page, such as the Elm programming language, architecture, compiler, and runtime.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things about learning a programming language is getting accustomed to its syntax. You’ll learn the basic syntax as well as data structures like lists, arrays, and records which you can use complex mattern-patching code for nested logic. You’ll also learn how to import third-party modules from elsewhere. Everything you’ve learned so far will help you appreciate and understand how Elm’s immutable values, pure functions, and a powerful type system lead to reliable and maintainable programs.</p>
<p>Elm is both a programming language and an architecture. Both are needed to build robust front-end web applications. After studying the programming language, you’ll study how the Elm architecture manages data flow in apps using the Model View Update pattern. By learning how to create, read, update, and delete data from a server by sending HTTP requests, you’ll be able to build single-page applications that can interact with JavaScript using ports, flags, and custom elements.</p>
<h3>How You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>This course consists of 8 chapters in total. You’ll learn by reading through the course chapters, looking at the example code, and implementing what you’ve learned on your PC.</p>

<p>My #2 pick for the best Elm course is <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/frontend-masters-introduction-to-elm-v2-118048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Introduction to Elm, v2</a> on Frontend Masters by the legendary Richard Feldman.</p>
<p>Who is he? He’s well known in the Elm community as the author of ‘<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/elm-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elm in Action</a>’, a thoroughly comprehensive book on Elm. He also worked for NoRedInk, one of the largest companies using Elm in production, and is currently working on making a revolutionary programming language heavily inspired by Elm called ‘<a href="https://www.roc-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roc</a>’.</p>
<p>In this <b>paid</b> course with <b>5 courses</b> <b>free trial</b>, Richard will guide you through the basics of the Elm programming language by building a complete Elm application. This application, a Medium clone, is called Conduit (get it? Haha). You’ll utilize elm-package for access to the Elm package ecosystem, incorporate elm-test for writing tests, work with third-party JavaScript libraries through JavaScript Interop, and more!</p>
<p>You should have some knowledge of JavaScript prior to taking this course.</p>
<h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>You’ll build a Medium clone called Conduit. You’ll start by setting up the basic Elm template for the project and learn Elm renders a page using the virtual DOM. Then, you’ll learn some of Elm’s basic syntax such as variables, booleans, if statements, and strings. Elm’s functional programming aspects will also be discussed, like how functions work, why data structures such as lists and records are immutable, and how to manipulate the DOM in spite of immutability.</p>
<p>The Elm architecture is the not-so-secret ingredient that makes Elm great. You’ll study how to make applications interactive using the Elm architecture. Afterward, you’ll explore Elm’s type system, including type annotations, the Maybe type, and making your own custom types.</p>
<p>The next section of the course goes further into web development. You’ll learn how to decode JSON structures and then talk to servers using HTTP requests. Finally, you’ll see how to interoperate with existing JavaScript code using Elm subscriptions.</p>
<h3>How You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>This course has 5–6 hours worth of material consisting of nine lessons and nine exercises.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/youtube-elm-basics-122047" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elm Basics</a> is a <b>free</b> short crash course where you’ll build a working Elm application in less than an hour with VSCode and Node.js. It covers less of the theoretical concepts and more on getting you started.</p>
<p>You should have some experience in any programming language to take this course.</p>
<h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>You’ll begin this course by setting up Elm in VSCode and its necessary plugins and tools, such as the REPL, make, and init. Then, after creating the source JSON file, you’ll initialize a local web development server and begin writing your first Elm application.</p>
<p>You’ll go over the basic structure of an Elm application, which consists of the main function as well as the Elm architecture of Model-View-Update. The three-part architecture requires an initial value of the model, a view function to represent the model on the screen and an update method to handle the changes to the data. Next, you’ll learn how to handle user input in the case of text forms or buttons, and trigger an event to send a message to the model and request an update to the model. You’ll also understand how to use the Maybe type to handle the possibility of errors when parsing user input.</p>
<h3>How You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>This course is 1 hour long. You’ll learn by watching the series of instructional videos and following along with the instructor as he demonstrates the ins-and-outs of developing an Elm application.</p>

<p>The official guide to Elm, <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/independent-an-introduction-to-elm-122048" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Introduction to Elm</a>, is a <b>free </b>comprehensive resource that will teach you the basics of programming in Elm, as well as fundamental principles and patterns to help you create interactive applications using the renowned Elm Architecture. By the end, you’ll have a concrete understanding of the core ideas and patterns that make Elm nice to use.</p>
<p>Prior experience with programming languages (JavaScript preferred) is required to take this course.</p>
<h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>You’ll start by immediately familiarizing yourself with the values and functions of Elm. Then, you’ll quickly explore the intuitive Elm architecture by building simple buttons, text fields, and forms programs.</p>
<p>Moving on, you’ll learn about types and even create custom types yourself as a way to guarantee that your app will not crash during runtime. Pattern matching will prove itself handy when extracting values from types that hold data, or when handling errors by using Maybe and Result types.</p>
<p>The Elm Architecture handles mouse and keyboard interactions, but what about talking to servers? You’ll learn about commands and subscriptions, which are ways to handle side effects in Elm such as making HTTP requests and working with JSON data. They can also help you interoperate with JavaScript by passing data between them JavaScript.</p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll learn web app structure and best practices of creating web apps in concepts such as in navigation, URL Parsing, and modules. Finally, you’ll learn how to optimize an Elm app through techniques such as Html.lazy and Html.keyed for rendering large lists of data in Elm and minification for reducing the size of your code.</p>
<h3>How You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>This course is 12 hours long. You’ll learn by reading through the course materials and applying what you’ve learned through your own practice.</p>

<p>Do you want to transition from using Elm as a hobby, to using it at work or at scale? This <b>paid</b> course is for you!</p>
<p>You’ll learn the best techniques for authentication, scaling, styling, module organization, Single Page Apps, performance optimization, and much more by looking at a real-world example app called Conduit, a Medium clone.</p>
<p>Experience with JavaScript is required to take this course.</p>
<h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>The course begins by exploring the benefits of opaque types and validated data to help the compiler look for unhandled edge cases and prevent the codebase from compiling. You’ll also also learn about extensible data and the difference between open and closed records, and practice creating your own custom types to add constraints to your code.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll delve into organizing and scaling Elm applications as they grow in size and complexity. You’ll study another kind of type called narrowing types and how to use them to create logical boundaries, rather than relying solely on file length.</p>
<p>Reusing parts of a user interface can speed up development time and help you resolve defects. Luckily, this can be done easily with helper functions. However, there are some cases where reuse isn’t best practice, and you’ll cover those cases in the course.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there can be multiple sources of truth for the same information. You’ll learn how to ensure there is only one source of information in the end product, along with learning how to decode types.</p>
<p>Finally, you will see how everything you have learned thus far relates to building single-page applications by examining the Conduit codebase.</p>
<h3>How You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>This course is 4–5 hours long, and consists of eight exercises and eight lessons. After each lesson, you’ll do an exercise based on what you’ve just learned.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Change</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what’s this “geography shift” about? Well, it stems from a significant event at Coursera: the “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">multi-year contract extension we secured with our largest industry partner in this new year</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”, as Hahn puts it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This largest industry partner is Google. Basically, Google renegotiated certain terms with Coursera — in particular, their revenue share agreement. To understand the significance of the new agreement, we have to first look at the old one. Here’s how Hahn described the previous arrangement:</span></p>
<div class="quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In lieu of a higher revenue share, some industry partners prioritize additional spend to promote their brand, global reach, and social impact initiatives, which is included as part of our operating expenses, primarily as sales and marketing efforts and content production.”</span><span class="quote_deco absolute top left height-100"> </span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, industry partners let Coursera get a bigger cut of the revenue generated by their offerings, and in return, Coursera invested into sales, marketing, and content production, which benefited their partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Coursera, this tradeoff had two immediate effects:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Higher margins</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Since Coursera got a bigger cut of the revenue, their margins improved. This is particularly notable in their consumer segment.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Higher operating expenses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Since Coursera invested more in sales, marketing, and content production, their operating expenses increased.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was able to verify this to a certain point by looking at Coursera’s segment margin and losses over the years. I came across these during my analysis of their </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-s1-analysis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IPO filing (S–1)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-annual-report-10k/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 annual report (10–K)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how Coursera defines the Segment (Consumer, Enterprise, and Degrees) Gross Margin:</span></p>
<div class="quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Segment gross profit represents segment revenue less content costs paid to educator partners; segment gross margin is the quotient of segment gross profit and segment revenue.</span><span class="quote_deco absolute top left height-100"> </span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s first </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/microcredentials/coursera-professional-certificate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional Certificate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Coursera, the </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/google-it-support-18565"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google IT Support Certificate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was announced back in 2018. But it was only in March 2021 that Google introduced three new certificates on the platform. As you can see above, in 2021, Coursera’s consumer margin jumped to 66%, from 55% the prior year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in Q2 2021, Coursera’s losses increased significantly, from 18.7M to 46.4M, as you can see below.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/coursera-quarterly-losses-2020-2022.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85528" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/coursera-quarterly-losses-2020-2022.png" alt="Coursera Quarterly Losses Graph" width="1666" height="1024" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/coursera-quarterly-losses-2020-2022.png 1666w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/coursera-quarterly-losses-2020-2022-300x184.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/coursera-quarterly-losses-2020-2022-1024x629.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/coursera-quarterly-losses-2020-2022-768x472.png 768w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/coursera-quarterly-losses-2020-2022-1536x944.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1666px) 100vw, 1666px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the expansion of Google’s offering coincided with a higher consumer margin and higher losses on Coursera’s side. This seems consistent with Hahn’s description of their prior agreement, suggesting that the losses might stem from the additional “<em>sales and marketing efforts and content production</em>”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those were the old terms. Now, let’s look at the new ones.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Impact</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new terms, Google and Coursera are switching to a more “standard revenue share”. And this transition is what is supposed to bring about the “geography shift” discussed earlier. Here’s how the CFO put it in the earnings call:</span></p>
<div class="quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, the transition to a more standard revenue share will result in a geography shift within the P&amp;L of an estimated 10 percentage points of total revenue, from operating expense to cost of revenue. </span><b>We now expect both total gross margin and our Consumer segment margin to be approximately 52% this year</b>.”<span class="quote_deco absolute top left height-100"> </span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-annual-report-10k/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coursera’s 2021 annual report (10–K)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the “cost of revenue” is defined as follows:</span></p>
<div class="quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cost of revenue consists of content costs in the form of a fee paid to educator partners and expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of the Company’s platform. These expenses include the cost of servicing both paid learner and educator partner support requests, hosting and bandwidth costs, amortization of acquired technology and internal-use software, customer payment processing fees, and allocated depreciation and facilities costs.”</span><span class="quote_deco absolute top left height-100"> </span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I think in this case, it’s mainly the content costs, in the form of a fee paid to partners. Per Coursera’s annual report, other expenses don’t seem to be factored into segment margins:</span></p>
<div class="quote relative padding-horz-large xlarge-up-padding-horz-xxlarge padding-vert-xxsmall margin-bottom-large quote-pull quote-text">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Expenses other than content costs included in cost of revenue are not allocated to segments because they are managed at the consolidated corporate level.”</span><span class="quote_deco absolute top left height-100"> </span></p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, Google will now take a bigger cut of the revenue generated by its offerings. But Coursera won’t be required to invest as much into sales and marketing. So for Coursera, content costs go up, but the operation expenses go down. This is the “geography shift” Hahn was talking about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for 2023, the Coursera CFO expects the company to “incur expenses of $25 million in 2023, which will be similar in nature to our historic spend for the program, including sales and marketing efforts, content production, and product development.”</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google’s Share of Coursera’s Revenue </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this begs the question: how much revenue does Google contribute to Coursera?</span></p>
<div class="table">
<table>
<caption style="caption-side: bottom;">Coursera: margin &amp; profit</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><b>2022</b></td>
<td><b>2023</b></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Total Revenue</b></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">$523M</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">$600M</span></td>

<tr>
<td><b>Gross Margin</b></td>

<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">$329M</span></td>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">$312M</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, Coursera expects revenue in the $595–605 million range, up from $523 million in 2022, which represents an increase of about 15%. But despite this growth, Coursera expects its 2023 gross profit to be less than in 2022. This is largely due to Coursera&#8217;s new contract with Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the new terms between Coursera and Google had come into effect a year earlier — that is, if the gross margin in 2022 had been 52% — Coursera’s gross profit in 2022 would have been $272M. That’s $57M less than what they actually made. So, can we assume that all this money is going to Google?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, we also know from Coursera’s annual report that “30% of our total revenue comes from the content and credentialing programs of five partners”. So for 2022 this amounts to $157 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This puts Google’s revenue in the $57–157 million range. Therefore, it’s quite possible that Coursera makes around $100M from Google courses. The new terms impact Coursera’s margin on this revenue, hence the “geography shift”.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/the-science-of-well-being-10346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Science of Well-Being</a>, offered by <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/university/yale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yale University</a> on Coursera, is an insightful course introducing practices to increase our well-being. Like most of us, my lifestyle significantly changed at the height of the pandemic. By spending most of the day at my apartment alone for months, I gradually began to question my personal values on happiness and wondered how I can increase my sense of fulfillment. So, I decided to enroll in this 10-week course, hoping that I can learn some insights to improve my well-being.</p>

<h2>Understanding What Makes Us Happy</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85400" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Although we generally believe that a good job, awesome stuff, or true love will make ourselves happy, psychologists advocate that this is an illusion. Professor Laurie Santos argues that they stop bringing you the happiness you expect and rest your reference point for the future, because you habituate with your high salary, fancy car, and partner. Throughout the course, she discusses why we have such misconceptions about happiness and how we can overcome our biases. After introducing what really increases our well-being, Professor Santos suggests strategies to develop habits to put them into practice. The encouraging finding in psychology is that we can work forward to improve our well-being, because actions and thoughts control 40% of our happiness.</p>
<p>For sure, some of the recommended rewirements, practices to increase our happiness, were rather common sense. I knew from my experiences that regular physical exercise, meditation, and good sleep improve my well-being. Still, what was interesting with this course is that all the suggestions were based on evidence from psychological research. For example, academic research using a brain scanner has shown that meditation not only increases your happiness via shutting off the default mode of mind wandering but also strengthens our brain over time. These empirical research findings increase my confidence and motivation to put them into practice.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85402" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-3.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-3.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-3-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-3-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, some of the findings were counter intuitive. For example, investments on experiences will make you happier than purchasing materials. My intuition was that material possessions such as a fancy new car will continue to bring happiness in the future. However, Professor Santos argued that while we habituate to a new car, a nice vacation will end well before we get used to it. In fact, when I recall my good memories in the past, vacations, especially the ones I spent with my family or friends, came on top of my list and certainly not the things I purchased for myself.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85401" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-2.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-2-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-2-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Furthermore, Professor Santos gave a fresh perspective on what can make you call a dream job. Instead of seeking high salaries, we should look for jobs that actively use our signature strengths, character strengths most essential to who we are. The act of using those strengths raises our happiness and lowers depressive symptoms, which in turn increases our productivity and job satisfaction. In fact, a good understanding of my signature strengths after taking a free self-assessment introduced in the course certainly gave me a new and interesting angle on how to approach my work differently.</p>
<h2>Practicing What Makes Us Happy</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85403" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-4.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-4.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-4-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The-Science-of-Well-Being-Yale-Concepts-4-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The last four weeks were devoted to practicing our favorite rewirement taught in the course. While I chose signature strength, my challenge was to practice it every day, which became apparent during the last week on the project. The positive momentum and enthusiasm can fade surprisingly quickly. I ended up procrastinating, which took me much longer to complete the Rewirement Challenge. This experience revealed that merely knowing something is not enough to put them into practice, which was referred to as the GI Joe fallacy in the first week of this course.</p>
<p>The important lesson was to have strategies for better habits, which was introduced in the sixth week. What I found interesting is that we need to think about the benefits and obstacles of our goal beforehand, if we want to keep overcoming obstacles. My tendency has been either optimistic without considering obstacles, or pessimistic focusing on obstacles, which have limited my potential. Furthermore, we should create beforehand implementation intentions and very specific if-then plans to respond to obstacles, so that we achieve our goal.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed this 10-week course. The teaching style was very engaging, full of insightful material, which helped me rethink what makes me happy. The recommended reading on signature strength was eye-opening, giving me the courage to confront the root causes of my personal problems and to find solutions for them. Because this course introduces many rewirements to improve your well-being, I am sure you can find something that would meet your preferences. Above all, my happiness score improved over the course. Highly recommended!</p>

<h2>What is Resume Writing?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A resume is a formal document, typically of one to two pages, that highlights a candidate’s education, experience and skills. Job seekers write resumes while applying for a job for recruiters to evaluate their competency and worth for the concerned job. Employers may collect resumes in person, through a company&#8217;s career website, a job search engine, or a professional social media page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word “resume” originally comes from the French word ‘</span><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/resume#word-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">résumé</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’, past participle of résumer which means “to summarize”. However, this term is primarily used in America and Canada to represent a document that showcases your skills and work experiences, and not in France and other parts of Europe where a curriculum vitae (or CV) is used instead. In India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, biodata is often used in place of a resume.</span></p>
<p><b>Fun fact</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Did you know that Leonardo da Vinci was the first recorded person to write a resume in the 15th century (even though it was more of a letter)?</span></p>

<h3>Why are Resume Writing Skills Important?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resumes create your first impression to potential employers. That’s why resume writing is an important skill to have. </span><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/what-is-a-resume" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes down a few more reasons why resumes are important:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provides an opportunity to market yourself to employers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outlines your skills, background and education so employers can easily see how your experience contributes to the success of a company</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helps employers eliminate unqualified candidates</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allows you to demonstrate your written communication skills</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>What is My Experience with Resume Writing?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout school and college, I was taught to write good resumes as part of my curriculum and I scored high too. And I landed a pretty decent job alright!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides that, I am a </span><a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/archisha-bhar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guided Project Instructor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a Beta Tester at Coursera, having tested many courses before they’re officially launched. I have taken </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/@archisha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over 50 online courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in various subjects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My experience as an online learner and teacher has given me some perspective on what to look for in an online course. I used my experience to evaluate each course in this list.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.classcentral.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-79248 size-full" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-2.png" alt="Find your next course on Class Central" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-2.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-2-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Class-Central-Preview-2-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<h2>Course Ranking Methodology</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology I used in previous rankings (</span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/category/best-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can find them all here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). It involves a three-step process:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Research:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I started by leveraging Class Central’s database with </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/subjects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">100K online courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and 200K+ reviews. Then, I made a preliminary selection of </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/subject/resume-writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50+ resume writing courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by rating, reviews, and bookmarks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Evaluate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I read through reviews on Class Central, Reddit, and course providers to understand what other learners thought about each course and combined it with my own experience as a </span><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/@archisha" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Select:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Well-made courses were picked if they presented valuable and engaging content and they have to fit in a set of criteria and be ranked accordingly: comprehensive curriculum, release date, affordability, ratings and enrollments.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result is a unique selection of courses that combines a decade of Class Central data and my own experience as an online learner to try to get the best of both worlds. So far, I’ve spent more than 10 hours building this list, and I’ll continue to update it.</span></p>
<h2>Course Ranking Statistics</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some statistics regarding this course ranking:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined, these courses have accrued over </span><b>760.6K</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enrollments.</span></li>

<h2>What is OCaml?</h2>
<p>OCaml is a general-purpose, statically-typed programming language with an emphasis on expressiveness and safety. It was designed in 1996 by Xavier Leroy and his team at INRIA in France as an extension of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Language</a> Caml dialect. Although Caml had a powerful type system and functional programming capabilities, it was only ever used in academia. However, by incorporating features such as object-oriented programming while retaining the correctness and conciseness of its predecessor, OCaml became a suitable language for building practical, real-world applications (which is what the O in OCaml formerly stood for Objective, if you were wondering).</p>
<p>OCaml&#8217;s strong type system, inherited from its predecessors, helps ensure code is safe and correct by catching errors at compile-time, while maintaining the flexibility of untyped languages by performing type inference. Not only that, OCaml’s algebraic data types allows for powerful pattern-matching capabilities, making it easy to match, extract and manipulate data in a concise and expressive way.</p>
<p>Many of OCaml’s features encourage programming in the functional style, such as preferring recursion and higher-order functions over traditional loops and preferring immutable data structures over mutable ones. However, it acknowledges that certain tasks  such as working with files and writing in-place algorithms can be difficult to accomplish using only functional methods. As a result, OCaml offers support for multiple programming paradigms like imperative and object-oriented programming, giving developers flexibility to choose the best paradigm for their problem.</p>
<p>OCaml is also known for performance and ability to easily integrate with other languages, such as C and JavaScript, making it a great choice for building multi-language systems.</p>
<p>As for its applications, OCaml is widely used in academia and research institutions, with many universities like Cornell and Princeton including it in their curriculum to teach functional programming. And although OCaml is relatively niche compared to other languages, it has been used in <a href="https://ocaml.org/industrial-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several large-scale industry projects</a> by companies such as Facebook for compilers and static analysis, Jane Street for guaranteeing the correctness of their internal trading systems, Coq for checking mathematical theorems, and Bloomberg for advanced financial derivatives risk management application.<br />

<h2>Best Courses Guides Methodology</h2>
<p>I built this ranking following the now tried-and-tested methodology used in previous Best Courses Guides (<a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/category/best-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can find them all here</a>). It involves a three-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Research:</b> I started by leveraging Class Central’s database with <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/subjects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100K online courses</a> and 200K+ reviews. Then, I made a preliminary selection of <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/subject/ocaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OCaml courses</a> by rating, reviews, and bookmarks.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Evaluate:</b> I read through reviews on Class Central, Reddit, and course providers to understand what other learners thought about each course and combined it with my own experience as a <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/@Elham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learner</a>.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Select:</b> Well-made courses were picked if they presented valuable and engaging content and they have to fit in a set of criteria and be ranked accordingly: comprehensive curriculum, affordability, release date, ratings and enrollments.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Course Ranking Statistics</h2>
<p>Here are some aggregate stats about the ranking:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">All of the courses in this ranking are <b>free</b> or <b>free-to-audit</b>.</li>
<li aria-level="1">All of the courses are suitable for beginners to OCaml. Unfortunately, none of the courses are geared towards complete beginners to programming.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Two of the courses are from universities while the rest are from independent providers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without further ado, let’s go through the top picks.</p>
<h2 id="anchor-1">1. <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/independent-ocaml-programming-correct-efficient-beautiful-121110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful  (Cornell University)</a></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-85426" src="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1.-OCaml-Programming_-Correct-Efficient-Beautiful-Cornell-University.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1.-OCaml-Programming_-Correct-Efficient-Beautiful-Cornell-University.png 1024w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1.-OCaml-Programming_-Correct-Efficient-Beautiful-Cornell-University-300x150.png 300w, https://www.classcentral.com/report/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1.-OCaml-Programming_-Correct-Efficient-Beautiful-Cornell-University-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The number one OCaml course in this ranking is <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/independent-ocaml-programming-correct-efficient-beautiful-121110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful</a> from Cornell University.</p>
<p>This <b>free</b> course is my top pick because it is both a textbook and a bite-sized video series. This means that you’ll learn not only through comprehensive written explanations and examples, but also through visual demonstrations and coding exercises.</p>
<p>The course covers a wide range of topics related to OCaml, including functional programming, correctness and efficiency, data structures, and best software engineering practices.</p>
<p>Prior knowledge programming in some mainstream imperative language (<a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/best-java-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Java</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/best-python-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a> preferred) and first-semester standard discrete mathematics is assumed prior to taking this course.</p>
<h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>You’ll start straight away by diving into the basics of OCaml, starting with basic syntax like writing expressions and functions. You’ll quickly familiarize yourself with the functional style of programming through extensive use of OCaml’s REPL.</p>
<p>As you become more comfortable with the language’s distinctive syntax, you’ll find yourself appreciating its underlying principles that help developers write concise yet expressive, correct yet efficient code. For example, OCaml is awesome for <a href="http://ocamlverse.net/content/compilers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing compilers</a> thanks to functional programming concepts such as parametric polymorphism, algebraic data types, higher-order programming, pattern matching. Hence, you’ll study all of these in-depth, along software engineering best practices such as error handling, testing, and documentation.</p>
<p>Not only that, data structures will also be covered in the course, from the ones available in the standard library to more complicated data structures that you’ll implement on your own using both imperative and functional programming. You’ll be able to analyze the efficiency of data structures using amortized analysis and choose the one that suits your use case.</p>
<p>Remember that I mentioned OCaml is great for writing compilers? Well, the final part of this course demystifies compilers enough for you to design and implement some small, special-purpose domain-specific languages (DSLs).</p>

<p>My second pick for the best OCaml course is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGC2in6hSHQcmT_cz4t7ePeQtTCkNkvll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Introduction to Functional Programming in OCaml</a> offered by Université de Paris.</p>
<p>This MOOC focuses on teaching the principles of functional programming using the OCaml programming language by emphasizing the use of functions as first-class values to create and manage complex data structures. The course will begin by showing the use of OCaml as a functional programming language alone, and by the end, it’ll demonstrate how OCaml can be utilized as a multi-paradigm language, combining functional and imperative programming styles to get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>To follow this course, you should already have some basic knowledge of writing simple computer programs in a programming language.</p>
<h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>You’ll begin the course with an overview of the language, starting with its robust type system. OCaml is statically-typed language, but thanks to its flexible type inference you’ll find yourself working with the type-checker rather than against it, and even create your own types. Combined with immutable data structures, such as tuples, records, and trees, you’ll see how they can be used effectively in your programs.</p>
<p>As a functional-first programming language, OCaml emphasizes the concepts of functional programming (FP), including the use of recursion over loops and the treatment of functions as first-class citizens. You’ll gain hands-on experience with key FP concepts such as partial function application, map and fold operations, and more.</p>
<p>By now, you’ve probably gotten a good understanding of how functional programming differs from imperative programming. Imperative programming is useful in some cases though, so you’ll explore OCaml’s imperative constructs such as modules, input/output, and exceptions.</p>
<h3>How You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>This course is 6 weeks long, with the total video watch time adding up to 7 hours. You’ll learn by watching the lecture videos and following along with the examples provided by the instructors.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.classcentral.com/course/youtube-programming-with-ocaml-122060" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Programming with OCaml</a> teaches the basics of programming in OCaml, especially how it differs from other traditional programming languages.</p>
<p>No prior knowledge of OCaml is required to take this course.</p>
<h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>You’ll start this course by getting familiar with the command line tool `utop`. You&#8217;ll explore OCaml&#8217;s powerful static type system, including its basic types such as integers, floats, booleans, strings, and characters. Additionally, you&#8217;ll be introduced to the concepts of recursion and higher-order functions, and understand why they&#8217;re often preferred over loops.</p>
<p>As you move on, you&#8217;ll delve into lists and pattern matching. You&#8217;ll learn how to create and add elements to lists in OCaml, and discover how they can be composed of different types using tuples. You&#8217;ll see the power of lists and tuples through practical examples of pattern matching.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, you’ll delve into higher-order functions, focusing on the functions that operate on lists such as List.map, List.filter, List.fold_left, and List.fold_right.</p>
<p>Finally, the course will cover advanced concepts like parametric polymorphism, which allows types with free variables to be replaced with any type, and inductive types, which are programmer-defined types created using the &#8220;type&#8221; keyword in OCaml. You&#8217;ll see an example of this by creating a &#8220;message&#8221; type with different constructors for string, bool, and float messages, and then defining a list of message types and writing a function that iterates over them.</p>
<h3>How You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>This course is 3–4 hours long. You’ll learn by watching the lecture videos, where you’ll see the instructor teaching the basics of the language as well as complete some practical exercises to recap what you’ve learned in the video.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/janestreet/learn-ocaml-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jane Street’s OCaml Workshop</a> aims to help people start developing in OCaml through small hands-on exercises and bigger, more complex projects like arcade games.</p>
<p>To take this workshop, you should have some experience with OCaml.</p>
<h3>What You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>After you get familiarized with OCaml’s build process and tools, you’ll complete twenty one exercises teaching you OCaml features such as pattern matching, higher order functions, options, and anonymous functions.</p>
<p>Once you get that covered, you’ll begin developing simplified clones of three arcade games: Snake, Lumines, and Frogger. Snake and Lumines both run on your computer, whereas Frogger runs on your web browser. Afterward, you can choose between several more advanced projects, such as writing a IRC bot, implementing <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">command-line fuzzy finder</a>, or improving Frogger.</p>
<h3>How You’ll Learn</h3>
<p>Two types of exercises are given: small coding exercises and large projects. Small coding exercises test your understanding of different programming aspects of the OCaml language, whereas the larger projects provide the opportunity to apply your knowledge and skills to more complex, real-world problems. You’ll need to pass the `expect` tests in order to fully complete the exercises.</p>
<p>The course also provides a few paths you can take after completing the exercises, but these come without `expect` tests.</p>
