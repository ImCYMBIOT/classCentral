# classCentral
 this project was a task given by Coding allstars as a part of test assignment for the post of python Dev intern
 Here we had to scrap the website of class central upto one level down and translate them into hindi.
 for this i made a python script to check the links and translate all the strings from en to hi. 
 the script is available in the other reposity called "website translator"
 the translator that i used , uses google translate api
